# Family Feud

Everything you'll need to run Family Feud for an online party!

## Setup Instructions
1. Make sure you have Python >= 3.6 installed
1. Have this repository cloned
1. `cd` into the `questions/sources` directory.
1. Run `python generate_questions.py`

1. Open two _separate_ browser windows:
    1. In the first one, navigate to [https://gabrielbrita.in/family-feud](https://gabrielbrita.in/family-feud). This is the **Player** window, and is the window you should screenshare.
    1. In the second one, navigate to [https://gabrielbrita.in/family-feud/admin](https://gabrielbrita.in/family-feud/admin). This window will be referred to as the **Admin** window.
1. In the **Admin** window, press the **Browse** button, navigate to the cloned repository, and select one of the question `JSON` files you've generated.
1. Run Family Feud as you remember it from TV. When a team gets an answer on the board, press the big checkbox next to the answer. This will reveal it to the players.
1. When the round ends, press **Add Points to Team 1** or **Add Points to Team 2** to add the points to the corresponding team.
1. Simply browse for another file to choose the next question, and start again!
